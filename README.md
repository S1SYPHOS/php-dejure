A PHP library for linking legal norms in texts with [dejure.org](https://dejure.org).


## History

This library started as an OOP port of `vernetzungsfunction.inc.php`, which can be [downloaded here](https://dejure.org/vernetzung.html). Since then, `php-dejure` heavily modified the underlying caching mechanism, now providing a broad range of fully configurable cache drivers while featuring more text processing options.


## Getting started

Install this package with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```text
composer require S1SYPHOS/php-dejure
```

An example implementation could look something like this:

```php
<?php

require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

use S1SYPHOS\DejureOnline;

$object = new DejureOnline();

$object->setEmail('hello@mydomain.com');
$object->setTarget('_blank');

$text  = '<div>';
$text .= 'This is a <strong>simple</strong> HTML text.';
$text .= 'It contains legal norms, like ยง Art. 12 GG.';
$text .= '.. or ยง 433 BGB!';
$text .= '</div>';

echo $object->dejurify($text);
```


## Roadmap

- [ ] Add tests
- [x] ~~Add checks to `__construct`~~
- [x] ~~Attempt cache directory creation~~
- [x] ~~Improve code~~
- [x] ~~Improve code more~~
- [x] ~~Translate code (almost done)~~
- [x] ~~`join` paths, so trailing slash is no longer required~~
- [x] ~~Add cache reset function~~


**Happy coding!**
